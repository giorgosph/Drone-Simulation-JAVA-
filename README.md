# Drone Simulation

This is a project from second year of Computer Science course, in JAVA. The project represents a console version of iconic drones that are displayed in the console. The user can interact to add, move drones, save, load state etc. This idea is then implemented in a GUI version on the Drone Simulation GUI project.
